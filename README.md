# Event Modeling Specification — JSON Schema

This repository provides the **official JSON Schema definition** for the *Event Modeling Specification*.  
It defines the structure of event-modeled systems, including slices, commands, events, projections, screens, automations, and specifications.

🧩 **Schema file:** [`eventmodeling.schema.json`](./eventmodeling.schema.json)

🔗 **Tooling:** [https://nebulit.de/eventmodeling-tooling](https://nebulit.de/eventmodeling-tooling)

---

## 🌍 Purpose

The goal of this schema is to provide a **machine-readable contract** for Event Modeling tools and platforms.  
It ensures consistent structure, validation, and interoperability between modeling tools, visual editors, and code generators.

The schema defines how each concept in an Event Model (like a *Slice*, *Command*, or *Event*) should be represented in JSON.

This schema is used by the [Nebulit Event Modeling Tooling](https://nebulit.de/eventmodeling-tooling) to:
- validate event models created in the UI  
- export and import complete models  
- enable automation, prototype generation, and integration with downstream systems

---

## 📘 Schema Overview

The schema describes one top-level object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "slices": [ { ... } ]
}
```

Each **slice** groups related model elements that represent one vertical part of the system (for example: *Submit Cart*, *Fulfill Order*, *Publish Cart*).

### Key Definitions

| Definition | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Slice` | A vertical model slice containing commands, events, read models, and automations |
| `Element` | A single model element (Command, Event, Read Model, Screen, or Automation) |
| `Specification` | A behavior specification describing *given/when/then* examples |
| `Field` | A typed attribute belonging to a command, event, or projection |
| `Dependency` | A link between elements indicating message flow |
| `Actor` | Represents a system user or external system interacting with commands |
| `ScreenImage` | A UI representation of a screen |
| `Table` | A structured view used by projections or read models |

## 🧩 Example (Simplified)

A minimal valid JSON document might look like:

```json
{
  "slices": [
    {
      "id": "submit-cart",
      "title": "Submit Cart",
      "status": "Created",
      "context": "Shop",
      "sliceType": "STATE_CHANGE",
      "commands": [
        {
          "id": "submit-cart",
          "title": "Submit Cart",
          "type": "COMMAND",
          "fields": [],
          "dependencies": []
        }
      ],
      "events": [
        {
          "id": "cart-submitted",
          "title": "Cart Submitted",
          "type": "EVENT",
          "fields": [],
          "dependencies": []
        }
      ],
      "readmodels": [],
      "screens": [],
      "processors": [],
      "tables": [],
      "specifications": []
    }
  ]
}
```

You can use this file to **validate** that your event model matches the official structure.

## 🧰 Usage

### Validate a model file

You can validate a model JSON file against this schema using any JSON Schema validator.

#### Using `ajv-cli`

```bash
npm install -g ajv-cli
ajv validate -s eventmodeling.schema.json -d my-model.json
```

If your model file is valid, `ajv` will print:

```
my-model.json valid
```

Otherwise, it will report structural issues.

## 🧪 Integration with Nebulit Tooling

This schema is directly integrated with the [Nebulit Event Modeling Tooling](https://nebulit.de/eventmodeling-tooling), which provides:

- A visual modeling environment  
- Automatic JSON validation  
- Export/import of models conforming to this schema  
- Live prototype generation  
- Model consistency and dependency checks  

You can use this schema as the foundation for:
- Custom event modeling editors  
- Automated tests validating your event models  
- Code generators for events, commands, and projections
